## Tooling and Setup

Project FU is based on the [Boilerplate Template](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/SD-tutorial/SD01-Getting-started), using plain JavaScript and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for build tasks. Future plans include incorporating new frameworks such as [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)/[PostCSS](https://postcss.org/), migrating to [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as the default bundler, and using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)/[TyphonJS](https://github.com/typhonjs-fvtt-demo/template-svelte-esm) for UI components.

### Branches

- **main:** Mainline branch for v11 releases and above.
- **v10-maintenance:** Mainline branch for v10 builds.
- **dev:** Primary development branch for V10 and V11.
- **v11-dev:** Development branch for v11-specific work.

When opening a PR, ensure it goes into the most relevant branch.

### Prerequisite Software

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org)
- Code editor (recommended: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Setup

Clone the repository and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Building from Source

Start the build process in watch mode:

```bash
npm run watch
```

Or for a one-time build:
